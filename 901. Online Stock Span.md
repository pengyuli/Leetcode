# Online Stock Span
Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

 

Example 1:

Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

## 思路
根据对于单调栈的栈顶, 可以找到他前边的大于/小于自己的数列, 采用单调栈的方法. 这里实际上就是在找左边第一个比自己大的数字. stack中存储index, 为了记录之前的数字, 用一个list存储新进来的数字

### 代码

```
class StockSpanner {
    Stack<Integer> stack;
    List<Integer> list;
    public StockSpanner() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        list = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    
    public int next(int price) {
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && list.get(stack.peek()) <= price) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        int res = stack.isEmpty() ? list.size()+1: list.size() - stack.peek(); 
        stack.push(list.size()); // index of price
        list.add(price);
        return res;
    }
}

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * StockSpanner obj = new StockSpanner();
 * int param_1 = obj.next(price);
 */
