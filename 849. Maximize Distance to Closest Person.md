# Maximize Distance to Closest Person
You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to the closest person.

 

Example 1:


Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
Example 2:

Input: seats = [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
Example 3:

Input: seats = [0,1]
Output: 1

## 思路
用双指针, 一个记录当前进程, 一个记录前一个1的位置. 每次碰到1更新位置.  注意这里length的计算方法有个trick, 当遇到第一个1时候或者指针遍历完成数组, 此时记录距离是单向的, 就是只需要考虑一边

### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
       int n = seats.length;
        int i =0, res = 0;
        for (int j =0; j < n; j++) {
            if (seats[j] != 0) {
                int length = 0;
                if (i == 0) {
                    length = j -i;
                } else {
                    length = (j-i+1)/2;
                }
                res = Math.max(length, res);
                i = j+1;
            }
        }
        res = Math.max(n-i, res);
        return res;
    }
}
```
